# Q-Learning-with-Robby-the-Robot
In this simple program, we have Robby the Robot learning how to acquire cans in a grid, while also learning how to avoid his assailant, the robot cop Earl.

Super messy code because I didn't design it with classes, and was initially a much smaller program. Might take a while to read.
