# Q-Learning-with-Robby-the-Robot
In this simple program, we have Robby the Robot learning how to acquire cans in a grid, while also learning how to avoid his assailant, the robot cop Earl.

This program is an extension of a much, much smaller program where it was acceptable to use struct-types. Unfortunately, while it's an interesting program and I have it up here I wouldn't use it to study Q-learning.

This is an academic program. Please don't re-use any part of this program without citing source.
